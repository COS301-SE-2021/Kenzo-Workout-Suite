This was evident in the code I made on Visual Studio when I was 10 to make homework easier, to everything I have done thus far in university. I am known to be diligent, hard-working, efficient and communicative. As a combination of these characteristics I will be able to communicate clearly ideas and concerns, and address issues swiftly and promptly. My priority is your vision, and as team leader I will strive for nothing less than efficient code and sleek designs brought to you by Cracked Studios. |

What started as an early gaming addiction and habit to solve all pc related errors on my own evolved into a full-fledged admiration for programming and solving problems. I had officially begun my programming experience in grade 9 and since then continued to grow and learn about the many different aspects involving IT. Due to having been raised in many different backgrounds, communication amongst varying groups of people and individuals is one of my strong points and I always aim to resolve problems in a manner that all parties are satisfied. |
