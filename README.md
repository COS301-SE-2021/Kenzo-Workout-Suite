This was evident in the code I made on Visual Studio when I was 10 to make homework easier, to everything I have done thus far in university. I am known to be diligent, hard-working, efficient and communicative. As a combination of these characteristics I will be able to communicate clearly ideas and concerns, and address issues swiftly and promptly. My priority is your vision, and as team leader I will strive for nothing less than efficient code and sleek designs brought to you by Cracked Studios. |
